## Optimistic Ethereum

::: tip Heads up
This is our "restricted" mainnet.
We currently have a whitelist system in place that limits who can deploy contracts to this network (for security reasons).
We know this isn't ideal and we really appreciate your patience while we work hard to make sure that the system is 100% safe ðŸ’—.
