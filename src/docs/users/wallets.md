The programming interface for Optimistic Ethereum is very similar to the 
interface for regular Ethereum, so most wallets should work as long as you
follow these rules:

# Document how to get a valid RPC URL

- Use a valid RPC URL   
- Use the correct 
  [chainID](/docs/operations/networks.html): 
  **10** for the production Optimistic Ethereum network, 
  **69** for the Optimistic Kovan test network.
- Keep the fees that the dapp specifies. Fees on Optimistic Ethereum are not
  freely editable as they are on the main network.


These are wallets that we verified work with Optimistic Ethereum:

# GOON, document the other three
