## Synthetix

[Synthetix](https://docs.synthetix.io/litepaper) is a system designed to
let users hold and trade synthetic assets whose value can be tied to
[real-world assets](https://docs.synthetix.io/tokens/list). This enables
investment in those assets, and trading them, without having to hold the
underlying assets themselves. It works because stakers provide the
necessary liquidity and take the risk that assets will increase in
value beyond the value of their stake. In return, stakers get an interest
rate and a percent of every transaction in the synthetic assets.

lower price.


## Uniswap

[The Uniswap protocol](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/what-is-uniswap)
is a peer-to-peer system designed for
exchanging cryptocurrencies ([ERC-20
Tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/))
on Ethereum blockchains. The protocol is implemented as a set
of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize
censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any
trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

learn how Optimistic Ethereum lets you trade cryptocurrencies for much
lower costs than it would cost you to execute the same trades on Ethereum mainnet.
