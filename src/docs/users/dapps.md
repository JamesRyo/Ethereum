[The Uniswap protocol](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/what-is-uniswap)
is a peer-to-peer1 system designed for 
exchanging cryptocurrencies ([ERC-20 
Tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)) 
on Ethereum blockchains. The protocol is implemented as a set 
of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize 
censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any
trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

learn how Optimistic Ethereum lets you trade cryptocurrencies for much
lower costs than it would cost you to execute the same trades on Ethereum mainnet.
