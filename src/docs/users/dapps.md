### [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/)

Synthetix is a system designed to let users hold and trade synthetic assets whose value can be tied to
[real-world assets](https://docs.synthetix.io/tokens/list).
This makes it possible to invest in and trade assets without actually having to hold the underlying assets.

### [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)

<img src="../../assets/logos/uniswap.png" width="200" align="right">

The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging [ERC20 Tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on EVM-compatible blockchains.
The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.
