## [Uniswap <img src="../../assets/logos/uniswap.png" height="50" align="right">](https://uniswap.org/)



The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging [ERC20 Tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on EVM-compatible blockchains.
The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.
