This makes it possible to invest in and trade assets without actually having to hold the underlying assets.

</br>

The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging [ERC20 Tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) on EVM-compatible blockchains.
The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.
