Optimistic Ethereum transactions require ETH, just as do L1 Ethereum
transactions (except a lot less of it). Here are some ways to get 
your Ether to Optimistic Ethereum.

* [The teleporter](https://portr.xyz/), a custodial gateway that
  allows you transfer up to 0.05 ETH. It is a cheap gateway, but a
  custodial one (meaning you trust the people running it to be 
  honest)
* [The Optimism Gateway](/docs/users/gateway.html#depositing-into-l2), 
  which costs more but allows for larger transfers and uses the same
  underlying trust mechanisms as Optimistic Ethereum itself.

At writing the other two bridges, [cBridge](https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer)
and [Hop](https://app.hop.exchange/), do not support ETH transfers.
However, they can be cheaper and faster option for depositing and withdrawing tokens.
