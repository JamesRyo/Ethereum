::: warning
Some API calls, such as the those in the [personal namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-personal) make no sense in a shared environment.
Such RPCs are either totally unsupported, or will return nonsensical values.

::: tip
**We strongly recommend all developers use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism). 
Weâ€™ve done extensive diligence and Alchemy powers our public API. ** 

We recommend Alchemy due to (a) the reliability, scalability and data correctness of its developer platform and (b) the comprehensive set of tooling and APIs they provide. You can run large applications on their massive free tier. 

### Alchemy's Description & Pricing

[Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/optimism-api-quickstart/?a=818c11a8da) is our recommended Optimism API provider and developer platform. Its robust, free tier offers access to (1) enhanced features like SDKs and enhanced APIs and (2) hosted Optimism nodes.

_(1) Alchemy's enhanced features_

Alchemy's free private RPC endpoint provides a complimentary suite of proprietary tools. These include a custom-built [Ethers.js SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/sdk/?a=818c11a8da) (which are supersets of the Ethers.js Provider and Wallet libraries) and [enhanced APIs](https://www.alchemy.com/enhanced-apis/?a=818c11a8da) such as NFT, Transfers, and Notify APIs.

_(2) Alchemy's hosted Optimism nodes_

Alchemy hosts our public API because of its data accuracy, reliability, and scalability. It counts companies like OpenSea, dYdX, and Facebook among its customers. Its API takes only a few lines of codes to get up and running. Alchemy isn't just a node provider, but also a developer platform and API provider.
