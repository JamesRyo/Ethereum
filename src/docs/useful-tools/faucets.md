## Testnet Faucets

[Optimism Faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) is a simple faucet for Optimism Goerli that drips ETH and OP. 
Authenticate with github, enter your wallet address, and you'll automatically be sent 0.2 ETH and 100 OP (if available) on the Optimism Goerli testnet.

You need to be following at least five people or organizations on github to be considered a real account. If you don't, follow more, log out of the faucet, and log back in.

For even more testETH, we recommend getting Goerli ETH from Alchemy's faucet [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/?a=818c11a8da). Alchemy's Goerli faucet provides 0.25 Goerli ETH per day.

### Other Goerli Faucets

(1) **[Alchemy](https://goerlifaucet.com/?a=818c11a8da)** is our recommended faucet. It provides 0.25 Goerli testETH per day. 

In general, Alchemy is a best-in-class API provider and developer platform that provides a comprehensive suite of free, proprietary tools. These include a custom-built [Ethers.js SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/sdk/?a=818c11a8da) and [enhanced APIs](https://www.alchemy.com/enhanced-apis/?a=818c11a8da) such as NFT, Transfers, and Notify APIs. These tools mean that web3 developers build and scale faster and more reliably for free. 

Alchemy powers major projects like OpenSea, The Graph, and OpenSea. It also powers our public endpoint. Beyond just getting test ETH, you can also run a large application for free using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/layer2/optimism/?a=818c11a8da). Overall, weâ€™ve done extensive diligence and Alchemy stands out for its reliability, scalability, and data correctness. 


(2) **[Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/)** providers ETH across many different testnets at the same time.
One of those networks is Goerli.

_Note that Kovan, Ropsten, and Rinkeby faucets have been deprecated due to [Ethereum's recent Merge](https://www.alchemy.com/the-merge/?a=818c11a8da)._

#### Next Steps

Once you have that Goerli, use [the Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to get it on Optimism Goerli.

## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
