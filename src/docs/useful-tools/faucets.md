### Perpetual Protocol Testnet Faucet

[Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/) gives you a small amount of ETH, and 10,000 USDC. 
They do this because you need USDC to [use their application](https://testnet.perp.exchange/).

### Optimism Kovan Faucet

## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
