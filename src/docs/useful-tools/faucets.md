## Testnet Faucets

[Optimism Faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) is a simple faucet for Optimism Goerli that drips ETH and OP. 
Authenticate with github, enter your wallet address and you'll automatically be sent 0.2 ETH and 100 OP (if available) on the Optimism Goerli testnet.

You need to be following at least five people or organizations on github to be considered a real account. If you don't, follow more, log out of the faucet, and log back in.

Note that you're also able to use it for Optimism Kovan for now.

### Goerli Faucets

These are faucets you can use to get test ETH on Goerli. 
Once you have that Goerli, use [the Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to get it on Optimism Goerli.

#### Paradigm MultiFaucet

[Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) is an easy way to get ETH on many different testnets at the same time.
One of those networks is Optimism Goerli.

#### Goerli Faucet

You can also get Goerli ETH [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/).


### Kovan specific faucets

These faucets are for the deprecated Kovan test network.

#### Perpetual Protocol Testnet Faucet

[Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/) gives you a small amount of ETH, and 10,000 USDC. 
They do this because you need USDC to [use their application](https://testnet.perp.exchange/).


## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
