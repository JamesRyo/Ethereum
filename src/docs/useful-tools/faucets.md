## Testnet Faucets

#### Optimism Faucet

[Optimism Faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) is a simple faucet for Optimism Goerli that drips ETH and OP. 
Authenticate with github, enter your wallet address, and you'll automatically be sent 0.2 ETH and 100 OP (if available) on the Optimism Goerli testnet.

You need to be following at least five people or organizations on github to be considered a real account. If you don't, follow more, log out of the faucet, and log back in.

One of those networks is Optimism Goerli.

#### Coinbase Wallet

Users of [coinbase wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) can get test ETH on Optimism Goerli directly from the wallet.


### Goerli Faucets

These are faucets you can use to get test ETH on Goerli. 
We recommend getting Goerli ETH from Alchemy's faucet [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/?a=818c11a8da). 
Alchemy's Goerli faucet provides 0.25 Goerli ETH per day.

Once you have that Goerli ETH, use [the Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to get it on Optimism Goerli.


## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
