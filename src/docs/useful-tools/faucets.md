## Testnet Faucets

#### Paradigm MultiFaucet

[Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) is an easy way to get ETH on many different testnets at the same time.
One of those networks is Optimism Goerli.

#### Coinbase

Users of [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) can get test ETH on Optimism Goerli directly from the Coinbase Wallet extension or via the [Coinbase Faucet website](https://coinbase.com/faucets/optimism-goerli-faucet).


### Goerli Faucets

These are faucets you can use to get test ETH on Goerli. 
We recommend getting Goerli ETH from Alchemy's faucet [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/?a=818c11a8da). 
Alchemy's Goerli faucet provides 0.25 Goerli ETH per day.

Once you have that Goerli ETH, use [the Optimism Bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to get it on Optimism Goerli.


## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
