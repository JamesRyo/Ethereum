::: tip Developer Tip
We recommend using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism) for its scalability, reliability, and data accuracy. 
:::

::: warning
Some API calls, such as those in the [personal namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-personal) make no sense in a shared environment.
Such RPCs are either totally unsupported, or will return nonsensical values.

## OP Mainnet

| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Network Name | **`Optimism`** |
| Description | **`Mainnet`** |
| Chain ID | **`10`** |
| Explorer | **[https://explorer.optimism.io](https://explorer.optimism.io)** |
| HTTP Endpoint | We recommend [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/optimism-api-quickstart/?a=818c11a8da). Optimism also provides this endpoint: **`https://mainnet.optimism.io`.** _But it is not for production systems and is rate limited._   |
| Sequencer URL<sup>1</sup> | **`https://mainnet-sequencer.optimism.io/`** |
| L1 Contract Addresses | [link](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/mainnet#layer-1-contracts) |
| L2 Contract Addresses | [link](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/mainnet#layer-2-contracts) |
| chainid.link | [https://chainid.link/?network=optimism](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism)

(1) The sequencer URL is write only, it only accepts `eth_sendRawTransaction` requests.

::: tip Developer Tip 
If you are seeing rate limit issues when testing with the public end point, or if you need websocket functionality, we recommend signing up for [Alchemy's](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism) free trial.

They are reproduced here for convenience.

### API Options:

1. Get free access to OP Mainnet through [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism)

2. For small scale tests, you can use our public API:
- HTTP endpoint: [https://mainnet.optimism.io](https://mainnet.optimism.io) (note, this is for testing. For production, use Alchemy) 

You can run a large application for free using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism). We’ve done extensive diligence and Alchemy is our recommendation due to reliability, scalability, and data correctness. They're the default API provider and developer platform for top projects like OpenSea and Facebook. 


### Parameters for node operators

These parameters are mostly useful to people responsible for running and administering network nodes.

| Parameter      | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| L1 Chain ID    | 1 |
| Rollup Config  | This network does not require a rollup config. Specify `--network=mainnet` on the command line
| Withdrawal period | 1 week |

(1) This file is compressed with `zstd`. 
We recommend that users install the command line tool if it is not already installed on their system. 
`tar -xf` will work without installing anything if you have an up to date version of `tar`. 
If you want to decompress separately, we recommend `pzstd -d`  or `zstd -d` (pzstd will likely be faster).

::: warning Ignore other networks

Optimism mainnet and Optimism Goerli are, from Optimism's perspective, production networks. This means our Goerli network is something you can rely on for consistent state and uptime. We have other testnets that we use to test our code (such as the Goerli Nightly network) that we use to test new features. These networks are for _us_ to test, and therefore might not have reliable state & uptime. 

If you want to test out our new infrastructure before it is stable, or are interested in working on the latest and greatest protocols please check these networks out! If not, they are best ignored. 
We try to make sure they work and preserve the state.
In the months prior to a major release, such as Bedrock, we may have a different network for testing dapps on that release.

However, we also have other networks such as [Goerli Nightly](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/goerli-nightly).
These are networks that are used for internal Optimism development.
Unless you are working on the Optimism protocol (rather than building things on top of it), ignore these networks.
