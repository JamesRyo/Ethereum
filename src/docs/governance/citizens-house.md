The Citizens' House will be responsible for distributing Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) based on contributions to public goods in the Optimism ecosystem.
The details of RPGF are still being worked out and the Foundation will publish them here when available.

Over time, the Citizens' House may take on additional duties as well.

## Retroactive Public Goods Funding

[Public goods](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) are an essential part of both the Optimism ecosystem and the larger Ethereum ecosystem.
To encourage public good production the Citizens' House is going to recognize and reward (with OP tokens) teams that produce valuable public goods. 
Public goods funding is going to be retroactive because it is relatively easy to agree on what is useful, and see who built it. 
It is a lot harder to identify in advance what will be useful, and which team will do the best job of building it.
