The Citizens' House is responsible for distributing Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF). 
Citizens' House votes will be based on contributions to public goods in the Optimism ecosystem.
We are still working out the details, we will publish them here when available.

## Retroactive Public Goods Funding

[Public goods](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/5608921918875-What-are-public-goods-) are an essential part of both the Optimism ecosystem and the larger Ethereum ecosystem.
To encourage public good production the Citizens' House is going to recognize and reward (with OP tokens) teams that produce valuable public goods. 
The rewards will be retroactive because it is easier to recognize what was written in the past and is currently useful than it is to recognize what will be useful in the future if it were to be written.
