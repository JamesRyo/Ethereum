title: Token House governance
lang: en-US
---

[The Working Constitution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55) outlines governing provisions and principles for the Collective. 
It will remain in effect no more than four years from the date of its adoption. 
After that, authority over governance will be ceded to a permanent Bedrock Constitution that incorporates the lessons of the Collective’s prior governance experiments.

The Collective’s [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md) describes current governance processes for the Token House. 
It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. 
The version linked here, from [the Optimism Foundation's github repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual), is the authoritative one.

## Seasons and voting cycles

Token House governance operates on a seasonal schedule.
Season two begins on September 7th, 2022, with voting cycle six.
Seasons are separated with a three-week Reflection Period, during which time iterative improvements to the governance process are proposed and voted on via a two-week Special Voting Cycles. 
During each Season, Token House voting occurs via three-week voting cycles. 
Voting Cycles begin on Wednesdays at 19:00p GMT (12p PST) and end on Tuesdays at 19:00 GMT (12p PST).

You can see up to date information about the seasons and voting cycles in [the governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y180aHVpNzBpdG0wODllN3Q4cTUwaGVoMWtub0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

## How do I get involved?

###  Step 1: Claim or purchase OP tokens

To check your eligibility for Airdrop #1, scroll to the bottom of [this page](https://app.optimism.io/announcement). 
If you didn’t qualify for Airdrop #1, don’t worry, [there will be more](allocations/#future-airdrops-2-3).
      
Claim your tokens by visiting **[the airdrop app](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check).** 
It doesn’t cost anything to claim the airdrop, except for gas fees. 
You will need to make sure you have some ETH on the Optimism network to pay for gas (0.003 is usually enough).
[See here](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/sections/4413033248795-Deposit) to learn how to deposit ETH to Optimism.

Didn’t qualify or just want more OP? OP is available to buy on all major exchanges deployed on Optimism.

### Step 2: Delegate your tokens (to someone else or yourself)

Participating in governance of the Optimism Token House will require a serious time commitment. 
For this reason, we strongly encourage people to delegate the voting power of their OP tokens to a community member who has explicitly volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance. 
If you do not wish to delegate your voting power to a representative, you will still need to delegate to yourself in order to vote.
        
* [See here](delegate.md) for the delegate guide.
* [See here](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/6389519530779-How-do-I-see-how-my-delegate-voted-) to get a delegate's voting record.

### Step 3: Join the conversation
Comment in the [Proposal Discussion](proposals.md) section of the [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/) and provide feedback on draft proposals.

::: tip        
             
Make sure you understand and follow the Forum's [code of conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct/5/4)

### Step 4: Vote (if you are a delegate)

Go to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth), connect your wallet, and vote.
There is no minimum OP holding voting requirement, but you will need to have the OP tokens you wish to delegate or vote with in your wallet when the voting snapshot is taken. 
Tokens that are staked or LP’d when the snapshot is taken do not carry voting power.
