title: Token House governance
lang: en-US
---

[The Working Constitution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55) outlines governing provisions and principles for the Collective. 
It will remain in effect no more than four years from the date of its adoption. 
After that, authority over governance will be ceded to a permanent Bedrock Constitution that incorporates the lessons of the Collective’s prior governance experiments.

The Collective’s [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md) describes current governance processes for the Token House. 
It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. 
The version linked here, from [the Optimism Foundation's github repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual), is the authoritative one.

## Seasons and voting cycles

Token House governance operates on a seasonal schedule.
Season two begins on September 7th, 2022, with voting cycle six.
Seasons are separated with a three-week Reflection Period, during which time iterative improvements to the governance process are proposed and voted on via a two-week Special Voting Cycles. 
During each Season, Token House voting occurs via three-week voting cycles. 
Voting Cycles begin on Wednesdays at 19:00p GMT (12p PST) and end on Tuesdays at 19:00 GMT (12p PST).

You can see up to date information about the seasons and voting cycles in [the governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y180aHVpNzBpdG0wODllN3Q4cTUwaGVoMWtub0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
