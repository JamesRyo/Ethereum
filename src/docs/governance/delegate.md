Participating in Token House governance can require a serious time commitment. 
For this reason, people are able to delegate their OP to community members who have explicitly volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance. 

Being a delegate is an important job that comes with a lot of responsibility.
Before deciding to become a delegate you should be familiar with:

* The [Working Constitution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55).
* The [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md).
* The [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943)


## Ready to be a delegate?

This is the process to become a delegate:

### Step 1: Commit

* Read the delegate responsibilities
* Post a completed [delegate commitment form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235). 
  If you have any questions about the form, ask in the [delegation questions feedback thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegation-questions-feedback-thread/236)
* It is not required, but you probably also want to [delegate your OP tokens' voting power to yourself](https://app.optimism.io/delegates).
  Please note that the expectation is that token grants **will not be** self-delegated to grant recipients.

### Step 2: Set up your profile  

* Set up your delegate profile. 

  Please note that delegate avatars are taken from ENS. 
  [If you want to change your avatar, you’ll need to do it via ENS](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/step-by-step-guide-to-setting-an-nft-as-your-ens-profile-avatar-3562d39567fc).

  The Optimism Foundation will add new profiles to the [delegate site](https://app.optimism.io/delegates) once per Season.
