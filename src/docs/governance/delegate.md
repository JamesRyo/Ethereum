Participating in Token House governance can require a serious time commitment. 
For this reason, people are able to delegate their OP to community members who have explicitly volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance. 

Being a delegate is an important job that comes with a lot of responsibility.
Before deciding to become a delegate you should be familiar with:

* The [Working Constitution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55).
* The [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md).
* The [Delegate Code of Conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943)


## Ready to be a delegate?

This is the process to become a delegate:

### Step 1: Commit

* Read the delegate responsibilities on the [forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) and make sure you understand the responsibilities. 


### Step 2: Set up your profile  

* Register to be a delegate on the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/) following the [delegate commitment form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235)
* It is not required, but you probably also want to [delegate your OP tokens' voting power to yourself](https://vote.optimism.io/).
  Please note that the expectation is that token grants **will not be** self-delegated to grant recipients.
