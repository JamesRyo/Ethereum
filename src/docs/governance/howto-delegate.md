title: How to Delegate

##  Step 1: Claim or purchase OP tokens

To check your eligibility for Airdrop #1, scroll to the bottom of [this page](https://app.optimism.io/announcement). 
If you didn’t qualify for Airdrop #1, don’t worry, there will be more.
      
Claim your tokens by visiting **[the airdrop app](https://app.optimism.io/airdrop/check).** 
It doesn’t cost anything to claim the airdrop, except for gas fees. 
You will need to make sure you have some ETH on the Optimism network to pay for gas (0.003 is usually enough).
[Learn here how to deposit ETH to Optimism](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/sections/4413033248795-Deposit).

Didn’t qualify or just want more OP? OP is available to buy on all major exchanges deployed on Optimism.

## Step 2: Delegate your tokens (to someone else or yourself)

Participating in governance of the Optimism Token House will require a serious time commitment. 
For this reason, The Optimism Foundation strongly encourages people to delegate the voting power of their OP tokens to a community member who has explicitly volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance. 
If you do not wish to delegate your voting power to a representative, you will still need to delegate to yourself in order to vote.

## Step 3: Join the conversation

## Step 4: Vote (if you are a delegate)

Go to [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth), connect your wallet, and vote.
There is no minimum OP holding voting requirement, but you will need to have the OP tokens you wish to delegate or vote with in your wallet when the voting snapshot is taken. 
Tokens that are staked or LP’d when the snapshot is taken do not carry voting power.
