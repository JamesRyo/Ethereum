## Grant Proposals


Projects can currently submit a Phase 1 proposal to request any amount of OP tokens from the Governance Fund. 
The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. 
This does not mean that all grants must be incentive programs. 
The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects. 

However, funding should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables. 
It is not the intended purpose of the governance fund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future work.
There is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be distributed via [the Citizens' House](citizens-house.md) at a later date.

### Step 1: Write your proposal

For now just look at [successful proposals](https://gov.optimism.io/tags/c/proposals/38/passed) and follow the same general structure. 
We are working on a proposal template, but it is not ready yet.


### Step 2: Submit your proposal for feedback

Post in the `#gov-temp-check` channel in [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) to get community feedback. 
They will help make sure you are following the template and are not missing any important information

Once you’ve incorporated the feedback received in Discord, post your proposal in the [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38) and delegates will provide feedback during the next feedback period of the cycle, as outlined in the [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#proposal-process--components-of-a-valid-proposal)

If you do not receive delegate approval or want more time for feedback, re-post your updated proposal in the `#gov-temp-check`channel in [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) to receive additional feedback from the community.

### Step 3: Get delegate approval

You need 2 delegates with >0.5% of voting power to approve your proposal to be included in the next voting cycle.
Approved proposals will have the below phrase linked by 2 delegates in forum comments on Discourse:

> ”I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote."

After you receive this approval, your proposal will be included in the next voting cycle! Proposals marked as ready that do not have this approval will not get added to the voting cycle.


### Step 4: Voting
    
If your proposal is approved, you will be contacted by the Optimism Foundation for distribution of your tokens!

### Step 5: Stay Optimistic!

If your proposal doesn’t pass, you can resubmit an updated proposal, but you’ll need to create a new proposal and link to the proposal that previously failed

If your project has already had a proposal approved, you are still eligible to apply for further funding. 
However, we recommend that projects distribute their initial allocation of tokens before requesting further tokens. 
Projects are also encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future proposals.


## Other proposal types

Other than grants, there are [four types of proposals](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types) that you can submit:

- Protocol Upgrade
- Inflation Adjustment
- Director Removal

There is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a proposal but your proposal must be approved by a delegate with sufficient voting power to move to a vote (as defined in [the operating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types)).

The process for submitting these proposals is very similar to the one for grants.
Where there are differences, they are noted in the table in the operating manual.
