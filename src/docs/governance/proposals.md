Projects can currently submit a Phase 1 proposal to request any amount of OP tokens from the Governance Fund. 
The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. 
This does not mean that all grants must be incentive programs. 
The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects. 

However, funding should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables. 
It is not the intended purpose of the governance fund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future work.
There is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be distributed via [the Citizens' House](citizens-house.md) at a later date.
