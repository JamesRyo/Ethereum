## Governance Fund Grant Proposals

Projects may submit a proposal to request OP tokens from the [Governance Fund](https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-charter/3944). 
The Optimism Grants Council is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects. 

However, funding should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables. 
It is not the intended purpose of the Governance Fund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future work.
There is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be distributed via [the Citizens' House](citizens-house.md) at a later date.

When writing your proposal, please adhere to the [grant proposal template](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233).
 
You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting a grant proposal to the [Optimism Grants Council](https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Optimism-Grants-Council-090bb648d1854136b9630c608da7a8bc) and following the procedures outlined in the [Grants Council Internal Operating Procedures](https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Grants-Council-Internal-Procedures-504521342ee0402980321c56f1488542).


## Non-Grant Proposal Types

There are [other types of proposals](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types) that you can submit:

- Protocol Upgrade
- Inflation Adjustment
- Director Removal

There is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a proposal but all non-grant proposals must be approved by four delegates with sufficient voting power to move to a vote (as defined in [the operating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types)).

The process for submitting non-grant proposals is outlined in the [the operating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types)
