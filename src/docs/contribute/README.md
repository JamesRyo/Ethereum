There are plenty of ways to contribute, in particular we appreciate support in the following areas:

- Become an "Optimizer" and answer questions in the [Optimism Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jrnFEvq).
- Get involved in the protocol design process by proposing changes or new features or write parts of the spec yourself in the [optimistic-specs repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-specs).
- We occasionally fund [bounties on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/ethereum-optimism) too!
