::: tip EVM Equivalence
As Optimism is [EVM Equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), most debugging tools work out the box with Optimism.

## Tenderly 

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) lets you inspect any transaction execution, both for Optimistic Ethereum (mainnet) and Optimistic Kovan (testnet). You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transactions execution, as well as step into or over function calls.
