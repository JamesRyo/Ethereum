## Testnet Faucets

### Paradigm MultiFaucet

[Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) is an easy way to get ETH on many different testnets at the same time.
Just sign in with Twitter and you'll automatically be sent 1 ETH, 1 wETH, 500 DAI, and 5 NFTs on the Optimistic Kovan testnet.

## Mainnet Faucets

There currently are no faucets for getting ETH on the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet.
If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.
