# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Welcome to the primary documentation site for the Optimistic Ethereum (OE) protocol.
Here you'll find a large amount of information about Optimistic Ethereum and Optimistic Rollup systems in general.
So, **if you've ever wanted to know more about Optimistic Ethereum, you're in the right place.**
It's great to have you here ðŸ˜Š.

We know documentation can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, especially when the subject matter is unfamiliar.
Let's make sure you know where to go next!

## For: The Casually Interested Reader
Are you here because you're interested in Optimistic Ethereum at a high-level?

**We'd recommend starting with the [Optimistic Ethereum TL;DR](../protocol/tldr.md)** -- it's got a great explanation of the protocol at a high-level.
No deep Ethereum experience necessary.

If you don't find that page to be sufficiently deep, you can always check out our page explaining the Optimistic Ethereum [protocol in detail](../protocol/protocol.md).

::: tip Don't have the time for docs?

Check out this [collection of talks and videos](../resources/talks.md) to help you understand Optimistic Ethereum.
We'll even throw in the fun audio and visuals for free.
It's like the world's best portable source of esoteric blockchain knowledge!
