::: warning This guide is for bedrock
This guide is for the *bedrock* upgrade, which is coming in Q1, 2023.
Do not attempt to use this in production prior to that upgrade. Keep an eye on these docs or [our official Twitter](https://twitter.com/OPLabsPBC) for announcements.
:::

This document provides an overview of how to deploy a Bedrock node. To learn more about how Bedrock itself works and its motivations, please see [the specs on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/specs).

This document is designed to be a general overview of how to deploy a Bedrock node. An example bare-metal deployment is provided [at the end](#tutorial-bare-metal-deployment).

## Deployment Overview

A Bedrock deployment consists of two core components: 

1. The Rollup Node, which is responsible for deriving blocks from L1 and passing them to the Execution engine. It also participates in a peer-to-peer network that synchronizes unsubmitted blocks as the sequencer creates them. We refer to this component as `op-node`.
2. The Execution Engine, which is responsible for executing the blocks it receives from the rollup node and storing state. It also exposes standard JSON-RPC methods to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network. We refer to this component as `op-geth`, since our Execution Engine is [a minimal fork](https://op-geth.optimism.io/) of `go-ethereum`.

The Rollup Node and Execution Engine communicate with each other over JSON-RPC via the Engine API. This is similar to how regular Ethereum networks are deployed. The Rollup Node functions as Optimism's consensus client, and the Execution Engine as its execution client.

For Goerli and mainnet, you may also need to run a third component called Legacy Geth. Legacy Geth is used to serve execution traces for transactions prior to the Bedrock upgrade, which we refer to as "historical transactions". When the Rollup Node encounters an RPC call that requires historical execution traces, it will forward the request to Legacy Geth. Note, however, that unlike our previous networks requests for historical _data_ will be served by the Execution Engine directly. This distinction will be clarified later on in this document.

The architecture of a typical Bedrock deployment looks like this:

</div>

## Getting the Software

`op-geth` and `op-node` are available as Docker images. Consult the [documentation](./public-testnets.md) for the network you are participating in to get the correct image tag.

Legacy Geth uses version `0.5.29` of our old `l2geth` image.

You can also compile `op-geth` and `op-node` from source. See [the tutorial below](#tutorial-bare-metal-deployment) for a walkthrough.

## Node Configuration

:::warning
Always run `op-node` and `op-geth` in a one-to-one configuration. Don't run multiple `op-geth` instances behind one `op-node`, or vice versa.
:::

To configure your node, you will need to do the following:

1. Configure `op-node` to point to the correct L1, `op-geth`, and L2 network.
2. Initialize `op-geth` with the correct network parameters.
3. Configure `op-geth` to properly communicate with the Rollup Node.
4. Optionally, configure Legacy Geth.

### Configuring op-geth

:::tip
Even though the Docker image for the Execution Engine is called `op-geth`, the actually binary is still called `geth` in order to minimize differences between `op-geth` and `go-ethereum`.
:::

We'll start with `op-geth`'s configuration because it is more complex. As mentioned before, `op-geth` is a minimal fork of `go-ethereum`. As a result, it stores its state in a database that requires initialization. Initialization is done one of two ways, depending on which network you're deploying:

1. **With a Genesis File:** This is used for testnets or internal deployments that are not migrated from a legacy network. In this case, you'll download the genesis file and initialize the data directory via `geth init`.
2. **With a Data Directory:** This is used for networks that are migrated from a legacy network. In this case, you'll download a preconfigured data directory and extract it. No further initialization is necessary in this case, because the data directory contains the network's genesis information. 

Regardless of how `op-geth` is initialized, you'll need to ensure that you have sufficient disk space available to store the network's data. As of this writing, the mainnet data directory is ~100GB for a full node and ~1TB for an archival node. The Goerli data directory is ~6GB for a full node.

Instructions for each initialization method are below.

#### Initialization via Genesis File

`op-geth` uses JSON files to encode a network's genesis information. For networks that are initialized in this way, you'll receive a URL to the genesis JSON. You'll need to download the genesis JSON, then run the following command to initialize the data directory:

```bash
curl -o <path to genesis JSON> -sL <URL to genesis JSON>

geth init \
	 --datadir="<your data directory>" \
	 "<path to genesis JSON>"
```

#### Initialization via Data Directory

To initialize `op-geth` with a preconfigured data directory, simply download and extract the data directory to a place of your choosing. The data directory is exported as a tar file. An example command to do this is below:

```bash
curl -o <path to data directory> -sL <URL to data directory>
tar -xvf <path to data directory>
```

#### Configuration

Once `op-geth` is initialized, it can be configured via CLI flags. `op-geth` accepts all the [standard `go-ethereum` flags](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) as well as a few extra flags that are specific to Optimism. These flags are:

- `--rollup.historicalrpc`: Enables the historical RPC endpoint. This endpoint is used to fetch historical execution data from Legacy Geth. This flag is only necessary for upgraded networks.
- `--rollup.sequencerhttp`: HTTP endpoint of the sequencer. `op-geth` will route `eth_sendRawTransaction` calls to this URL. Bedrock does not currently have a public mempool, so this is required if you want your node to support transaction submission. Consult the documentation for the network you are participating in to get the correct URL.
- `--rollup.disabletxpoolgossip`: Disables transaction pool gossiping. While not required, it's useful to set this to `true` since transaction pool gossip is currently unsupported.

To communicate with `op-node` and enable the Engine API, you'll also need to generate a JWT secret file and enable Geth's authenticated RPC endpoint.

To generate the JWT secret, run the following:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

Then, specify the following flags:

- `--authrpc.addr`: Sets the address `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC should listen on.
- `--authrpc.port`: Sets the port `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC should listen on. The default value is `8551`.
- `--authrpc.jwtsecret`: Sets the path to a JWT secret file you generated above.
- `--syncmode=full`: This prevents Geth from attempting to snap sync. Snap sync is currently unsupported, but will be enabled shortly after the mainnet upgrade.
- `--maxpeers=0`: This prevents Geth from peering with other Geth nodes. Execution-layer peering is currently unsupported, but will be added as part of enabling snap sync.
- `--nodiscover`: This disables Geth's peer discovery mechanism. Execution-layer discovery is currently unsupported, but will be added as part of enabling snap sync.

#### Optional op-geth Configuration

You may also want to specify the following flags based on your configuration:

- `--authrpc.vhosts`: Whitelists which hosts (as defined in the `Host` header) are allowed to access the authenticated RPC endpoint. This is useful if you're running `op-geth` on containerized infrastructure. The default value is `localhost`.
- `--http.vhosts`: Whitelists which hosts (as defined in the `Host` header) are allowed to access the unauthenticated RPC endpoint. This is useful if you're running `op-geth` on containerized infrastructure. The default value is `localhost`.
- `--http`, `--http.addr`, and `--http.port`: Enables the unauthenticated RPC endpoint, configures its address, and configures its port. You'll almost certainly want to specify these, since they will enable Geth's JSON-RPC endpoint.
- `--ws`, `--ws.addr`, and `--ws.port`: Enables the WebSocket API.
- `--verbosity`: Configures Geth's log level. This is a number between 0 and 5, with 5 being the most verbose. Defaults to 3.

#### Working Base Configuration

A valid command that runs `op-geth` on our `beta-1` network and enables RPC over HTTP and WebSockets looks like:

```bash
geth \
  --ws \
  --ws.port=8546 \
  --ws.addr=localhost \
  --ws.origins="*" \
  --http \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --http.addr=localhost \
  --http.vhosts="*" \
  --http.corsdomain="*" \
  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=/var/secrets/jwt.txt \
  --authrpc.port=8551 \
  --authrpc.vhosts="*" \
  --datadir=/data \
  --verbosity=3 \
  --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true \
  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://bedrock-beta-1-sequencer.optimism.io \
  --nodiscover \
  --syncmode=full \
  --maxpeers=0
```

Consult [Geth's documentation](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/) for more information on customizing `op-geth`'s behavior.

### Configuring op-node

`op-node` is a standalone, statically linked binary. It stores no state, and requires no initialization. It consumes configuration parameters either via the command line or environment variables. For some networks, the Rollup Node also requires a configuration file (called `rollup.json` or the "rollup config") that configures network-specific genesis parameters. For official networks like Goerli and mainnet, the genesis config is hardcoded in the `op-node` software and can be specified via a `--network` flag.

A minimal valid configuration for a rollup node on our `beta-1` testnet looks like this:

```bash
op-node --l1=<goerli RPC url> \
        --l2=<op-geth authenticated RPC url> \
        --network=beta-1
        --rpc.addr=127.0.0.1 \
        --rpc.port=9545 \
        --l2.jwt-secret=<path to JWT secret>
```

You can manually specify a path to a rollup config with the `--rollup.config` flag. This is used for testnets or internal deployments that are not migrated from a legacy network.

Each of the above flags can also be defined via an environment variable. Run `op-node --help` to see a list of all available flags and environment variables.

#### Configuring Peer-to-Peer Networking

Unlike the previous system, the `op-node` participates in a peer-to-peer network. This network is used to distribute blocks that have not been submitted to L1 yet. The `op-node` will automatically discover and connect to peers using a hardcoded set of bootnodes. You can also manually specify peers to connect to via the `--p2p.static` flag.

For best results, run `op-node` with a static IP address that is accessible from the public Internet. For Kubernetes deployments, this can be achieved by configuring a dedicated `Ingress` with an external IP, and using the `--p2p.advertise.ip` flag to specify the IP address of the load balancer when advertising IP addresses to peers.

The default port for the peer-to-peer network is `9003`. You will need to open this port on your firewall to receive unsubmitted blocks. For your node to be discoverable, this port must be accessible via both TCP and UDP protocols.

### Legacy Geth

If you are running a node for an upgraded network like Goerli or mainnet, you will also need to run Legacy Geth in order to serve historical execution traces. Fundamentally, Legacy Geth is our old `l2geth` binary running against a preconfigured data directory. To configure Legacy Geth, follow the instructions above for using a preconfigured data directory, then execute the following command:

:::danger
It is imperative that you specify the `USING_OVM=true` environment variable in the command below. Failing to specify this will cause `l2geth` to return invalid execution traces, or panic at startup.
:::

```bash
USING_OVM=true \
  ETH1_SYNC_SERVICE_ENABLE=false \
  RPC_API=eth,rollup,net,web3,debug \
  RPC_ADDR=0.0.0.0 \
  RPC_CORS_DOMAIN=* \
  RPC_ENABLE=true \
  RPC_PORT=8545 \
  RPC_VHOSTS=* \
  geth --datadir <path to data directory>
```

This command is the minimum required to run Legacy Geth and expose a functioning RPC endpoint. As before, `l2geth` takes all standard `go-ethereum` flags so you can customize the configuration as needed.

As mentioned above, don't forget to specify `--rollup.historicalrpc` on `op-geth` to properly route requests for historical execution to Legacy Geth.

Since Legacy Geth is read-only, it is safe to run multiple Legacy Geth nodes behind a load balancer.

#### Historical Execution vs. Historical Data Routing

Only requests for historical execution will be routed to Legacy Geth. 
Everything else will be served by `op-geth` directly.
The term _historical execution_ refers to RPC methods that need to execute transactions prior to bedrock (not just read data from the database):

- `eth_call`
- `eth_estimateGas`
- `debug_traceBlockByNumber`
- `debug_traceBlockByHash`
- `debug_traceCall`
- `debug_traceTransaction`

If you do not need these RPC methods for historical data, then you do not need to run Legacy Geth at all.

## Tutorial: Bare Metal Deployment

The following is an example Bedrock deployment on a bare metal Ubuntu node. It connects to the `beta-1` testnet, and uses `systemd`. It also compiles `op-node` and `op-geth` from source.

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to perform a source build:

1. Common build tools like `git`, `make`, and friends.
2. `curl`
3. The Go toolchain.

Run the following commands to install these:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential curl
sudo snap install go --classic
```

You can also optionally install Cast via `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash` and `foundryup`. This will make it easier to interact with your node via RPC.

### Step 2: Build `op-node`

:::tip
Consult the [documentation](./public-testnets.md) for the network you're connecting to for the correct version of `op-node` to use. The commit below works for `beta-1`.
:::

Clone the Optimism monorepo, and build the binary:

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
git checkout 4ea2555c2185aa3b1011ac01838e13f30d833c2c
cd optimism/op-node
make op-node
sudo cp ./bin/op-node /usr/local/bin
```

### Step 3: Build `op-geth`

:::tip
Consult the [documentation](./public-testnets.md) for the network you're connecting to for the correct version of `op-geth` to use. The commit below works for `beta-1`.
:::

Clone the op-geth repository, check out the `30db39cae2be40252eff70b38e8ae927b377d6bd` commit, and build the binary:

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth.git
git checkout 30db39cae2be40252eff70b38e8ae927b377d6bd
cd op-geth
make geth
sudo cp ./build/bin/geth /usr/local/bin
```

### Step 4: Configure `op-geth` Genesis

This assumes that Geth's data directory will be `/data`. In practice, this will likely be an attached volume. We'll also create a custom user for the data directory as part of this process.

Run the following commands to configure the genesis file:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data
sudo useradd geth
sudo chown -R geth /data
cd /data
sudo -u geth curl -o genesis.json -sL https://storage.googleapis.com/bedrock-goerli-regenesis-data/beta-1/genesis.json
sudo -u geth geth init --datadir . genesis.json
```

### Step 5: Configure Services

We need to make a JWT secret to authenticate requests between the `op-node` and `op-geth`, and a P2P private key for the `op-node`. Run the following commands to do this:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/secrets
openssl rand -hex 32 | sudo tee /var/secrets/jwt.txt
openssl rand -hex 32 | sudo tee /var/secrets/p2p.txt
sudo chmod 755 /var/secrets/jwt.txt
sudo chmod 755 /var/secrets/p2p.txt
```

We'll create two services - one for `op-geth`, and another for `op-node`. First, place the following content in `/etc/systemd/system/op-geth.service`:

```unit file (systemd)
[Unit]
Description     = op-geth service
Wants           = network-online.target
After           = network-online.target 

[Service]
User            = geth
ExecStart       = /usr/local/bin/geth \
                  --ws \
                  --ws.port=8546 \
                  --ws.addr=localhost \
                  --ws.origins="*" \
                  --http \
                  --http.port=8545 \
                  --http.addr=localhost \
                  --http.vhosts="*" \
                  --http.corsdomain="*" \
                  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
                  --authrpc.jwtsecret=/var/secrets/jwt.txt \
                  --authrpc.port=8551 \
                  --datadir=/data \
                  --verbosity=3 \
                  --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true \
                  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://bedrock-beta-1-sequencer.optimism.io \
                  --nodiscover \
                  --networkid=902 \
                  --syncmode=full \
                  --maxpeers=0
Restart         = on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy	= default.target
```

Then, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable op-geth` to enable the service.

This will configure Geth to use the correct JWT, sequencer URL, and enable RPC over HTTP and WebSockets.

Now we'll configure the `op-node` service. Place the following content in `/etc/systemd/system/op-node.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description     = op-node service
Wants           = network-online.target
After           = network-online.target 

[Service]
User            = nobody
ExecStart       = /usr/local/bin/op-node \
                    --l1=<replace with a free Alchemy URL> \
                    --p2p.static=/dns4/bedrock-beta-1-replica-0.optimism.io/tcp/9003/p2p/16Uiu2HAmJgxPomiS3ZCLQSzq1dbnRV59y6Zvy9KeosCkZ9tXix38 \
                    --l2=http://localhost:8551 \
                    --network=beta-1 \
                    --rpc.addr=127.0.0.1 \
                    --rpc.port=9545 \
                    --p2p.priv.path=/var/secrets/p2p.txt \
                    --p2p.peerstore.path=memory \
                    --p2p.discovery.path=memory \
                    --l2.jwt-secret=/var/secrets/jwt.txt
Restart         = on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy	= default.target
```

In this configuration, the P2P peer and discovery stores are held in-memory. It also configures one of our replicas to be a static peer. In production, you'll want to persist this somewhere on disk. 

As before, enable the service with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable op-node`.

### Step 6: Start Services

Run the following:

```
sudo systemctl start op-geth
sudo systemctl start op-node
```

The nodes should start to sync. The full sync process may take some time. You can check the progress of the sync by running `cast block latest` and comparing the results either to one of our official replicas or to the network's block explorer. 

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized: Signature Invalid

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
WARN [12-13|15:53:20.263] Derivation process temporary error       attempts=80 err="stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: failed to fetch current L2 forkchoice state: failed to find the finalized L2 block: failed to determine L2BlockRef of finalized, could not get payload: 401 Unauthorized: signature is invalid
```

It means that the `op-node` is unable to authenticate with `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC using the JWT secret. To fix:

1. Check that the JWT secret is correct in both services.
2. Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

### 403 Forbidden: Invalid Host Specified

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"err":"403 Forbidden: invalid host specified\n","lvl":"eror","msg":"error getting latest header","t":"2022-12-13T22:29:18.932833159Z"}
```

It means that you have not whitelisted `op-node`'s host with `op-geth`. To fix:

1. Make sure that the `--authrpc.vhosts` parameter in `op-geth` is either set to the correct host, or `*`.
2. Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

### Failed to Load P2P Config

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
CRIT [12-13|13:46:21.386] Application failed                       message="failed to load p2p config: failed to load p2p discovery options: failed to open discovery db: mkdir /p2p: permission denied"
```

It means that the `op-node` does not have write access to the P2P discovery or peerstore directories. To fix:

1. Make sure that the `op-node` has write access to the P2P directory. By default, this is `/p2p`.
2. Set the P2P directory to somewhere the `op-node` can access via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.
3. Set the discovery path to `memory` to disable persistence via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.

### Wrong Chain

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"attempts":183,"err":"stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: wrong chain L1: genesis: 0x4104895a540d87127ff11eef0d51d8f63ce00a6fc211db751a45a4b3a61a9c83:8106656, got 0x12e2c18a3ac50f74d3dd3c0ed7cb751cc924c2985de3dfed44080e683954f1dd:8106656","lvl":"warn","msg":"Derivation process temporary error","t":"2022-12-13T23:31:37.855253213Z"}
```

It means that the `op-node` is pointing to the wrong chain. To fix:

1. Verify that the `op-node`'s L1 URL is pointing to the correct L1 for the given network.
2. Verify that the `op-node`'s rollup config/`--network` parameter is set to the correct network.
3. Verify that the `op-node`'s L2 URL is pointing to the correct instance of `op-geth`, and that `op-geth` is properly initialized for the given network.

## Further Reading

Now that you've got your node up and running, check out the [Upgrade Guide](./upgrade-guide.md) for what to expect when we upgrade our official testnet and mainnet.
