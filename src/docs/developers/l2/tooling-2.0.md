# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

::: warning OVM 2.0 Page
This page refers to the **new** state of Optimistic Ethereum after the
OVM 2.0 update. We expect to deploy OVM 2.0 mid October on the Kovan
test network and by the end of October on the production network.
:::

There is no more need for special tooling. Just add 
[the appropriate Optimistic Network](/docs/infra/networks.html) to the
configuration file.
