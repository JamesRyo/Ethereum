## Whitelisting

We currently require addresses to be whitelisted before they can deploy onto the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet.
To get the full rundown, [see our post on Medium](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/community-launch-7c9a2a9d3e84).
Whitelisting is easy, just do the following:

1. Deploy your contracts to our Optimistic Kovan test network
2. Verify each of these contracts on [Optimistic Kovan Etherscan](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io)
3. Fill out [the Whitelist application form](https://optimismpbc.typeform.com/onboard)
