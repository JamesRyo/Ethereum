How do you use your favorite tools for building contracts when you're working with Optimism?
Just use them!

Optimism isn't just EVM compatible, it's EVM *equivalent*.
All the Ethereum tooling you know and love should work on Optimism without lots of fiddling.
Hardhat? Brownie? Truffle?
Yep, yep, and yep.


If you find a tool that *doesn't* seem to work with Optimism out of the box, try [opening an issue over on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues).
Someone working on Optimism will probably help fix the issue pretty quickly!
