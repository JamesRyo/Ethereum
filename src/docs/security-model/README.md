title: Optimism's Security Model
lang: en-US
---

Security in crypto is vital. Users, developers and infrastructure providers expect the code to work as intended. When it doesn't, these same groups (rightfully) demand a fast, secure, and clearly communicated fix. 

Over the years at Optimism we have learned a great deal about this delicate balance, and the importance of transparency around security models. It is not good enough to just be transparent, it also needs to be accessible. If the average user cannot understand your security model then it does not matter how transparent it is. 

In line with this philosophy of transparency we have a very accessible run down of [Optimism's security model](./optimism-security-model.md) that anyone can understand. 

We also have a long standing [bug bounty program](./bounties.md) that has paid out one of the largest open source software bounties ever! 

We take your trust very seriously and we are super excited to have you along for our decentralisation journey.
