Welcome to our documentation site, and thanks for your interest in learning more about Optimistic Ethereum!

- [Protocol Docs](./protocol.md): will provide an understanding of how the system functions under the hood.
- [Integration Docs](./integration.md): will outline the minor modifications necessary to adapt a smart contract application to run on Optimistic Ethereum. Look for these docs to land around Feb 15, 2021.
