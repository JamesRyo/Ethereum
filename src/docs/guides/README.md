Welcome to the Optimism Guides!

These guides provide integration guidelines for specific topics.
They are intended as one stop shops, and should have all the relevant information you need for completing a specific type of integration, from network information and tutorials to tips and tricks.

We're aiming to maintain guides for many of the common interactions that developers might have with Optimism.
For example, we have guides for adding Optimism support to a [wallet](./wallet-dev.md) or a [CEX](./cex-dev.md).
We also have guides for getting your [token onto the standard bridge](./token-dev.md) or even [writing your own custom bridge](./bridge-dev.md).

Take a look at the list on the left for a complete list of the guides we've created so far.

## Want a specific guide added?

Are we missing an important use case?
We'd love to hear from you in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues) or on [Discord](https://discord.optimism.io).
