Guides are collections of important links and resources that are needed to do specific tasks on Optimism. As such, we have guides for Smart Contract developers, Token developers (ERC20 tokens, as well as how to bridge), CEX developers and wallet developers. 

These guides are intended to be one stop shops of all the information you would need. 

If you found missing information in a guide that you think is essential for what it is trying to cover, please make an issue in GitHub or raise it as an issue in discord. 

Happy coding!
