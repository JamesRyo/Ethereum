Welcome to the Optimism Guides!

These guides provide integration guidelines for specific topics. They are intended as one stop shops, and should have all the relevant information you need for completing a specific type of integration, from network information and tutorials to tips and tricks.

We have guides for adding Optimism support to a [wallet](./wallet-dev.md) or a [CEX](./cex-dev.md). Guides for getting your [token onto the standard bridge](./token-dev.md) or even [writing your own custom bridge](./bridge-dev.md).

See developing [smart contracts on Optimism](./smart-contract-devs.md) when you are interested in getting yourself setup to write and deploy contracts on Optimism.

## Want a specific guide added?

Do you think we are missing an important use case? We'd love to hear from you in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues) or on [Discord](https://discord.optimism.io).
