Each of these faucets can be used to get testnet funds on Optimism Kovan. 
Just sign in with Twitter and you'll automatically be sent 1 ETH, 1 wETH, 500 DAI, and 5 NFTs on the Optimism Kovan testnet.
[Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/) gives you a small amount of ETH, and 10,000 USDC. 
### Optimism Kovan Faucet
[Optimism Faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) is a simple faucet for Optimism Kovan that drips ETH and DAI. Authenticate with github, enter your wallet address and you'll aumatically be sent 1 ETH and 100 DAI on the Optimism Kovan testnet.

We'll demonstrate the process for deploying an instance of a sample token on Optimism Kovan testnet using [Etherscan](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/). The same process is applicable to Optimism Mainnet.
Here we'll be using the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) Chrome extension to interact with the Optimism Kovan testnet.
For now, simply [head to this link](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism-kovan) and click "Connect".
Accept the popup that shows up in MetaMask and you'll be connected to the Optimism Kovan testnet.
You'll need some ETH on the Optimism Kovan testnet to deploy a contract.
The [Paradigm Multifaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) is a quick and easy way to get ETH on a whole bunch of testnets, including the Optimism Kovan testnet.

3. Select "Connect to Web3" to connect to Metamask on Optimism Kovan.
In this example we are using the ENS kovan token from [https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x6B7420E3D9115CB1D2A593bD7f6BD15a06506Caf](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x6B7420E3D9115CB1D2A593bD7f6BD15a06506Caf) and creating an Optimism `L2StandardERC20` token instance this can be bridged to.
For example for us this is [https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x0f71c0c2af9308260f7d5d89782064c28d32b52ea2b5c8fdaff8922185dde79a](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x0f71c0c2af9308260f7d5d89782064c28d32b52ea2b5c8fdaff8922185dde79a)

To add your bridge and token to the token list, you must make a pull request against the [Optimism token list repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#adding-a-token-to-the-list). Due to the complexity of reviewing a custom bridge, you will need to deploy to Optimism kovan first, before going to production. This is an example of a custom bridge [deployed on kovan](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/46/files) for testing, before being [deployed to mainnet](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/45/files).
./docs/guides/bridge-dev.md





Transactions sent from L1 to L2 take up to approximately 15 minutes on mainnet and 5 minutes on the Optimism Kovan testnet to reach the target L2 contract.
L2 to L1 transactions must wait 7 days on mainnet and 60 seconds on the Optimism Kovan testnet before they *can* be executed on Ethereum.

You will be able to catch this failure by testing your contracts on Optimism Kovan.
We highly recommend testing all contracts on Optimism Kovan before deploying to the Optimism mainnet in order to catch this issue.
./docs/developers/known-issues.md



We'll demonstrate how easy it is to get started by deploying a basic contract to the Optimism Kovan testnet using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
Here we'll be using the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) Chrome extension to interact with the Optimism Kovan testnet.
For now, simply [head to this link](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism-kovan) and click "Connect".
Accept the popup that shows up in MetaMask and you'll be connected to the Optimism Kovan testnet.
You might want to see more information about your contract by visiting [Optimistic Etherscan](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io).
